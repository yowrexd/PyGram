Mystra: Hey there! Ever wondered who designs the blueprints for complex software systems?
- Yes, tell me more!
	Mystra: That's what Software Architects do! They're like the master planners of the software world.
	=> role_overview
- What's a Software Architect?
	Mystra: Let me show you how these technical visionaries shape the future of software!
	=> role_overview

~ role_overview
Mystra: A Software Architect is like a city planner, but for software systems:
Mystra: • Designs the big picture
Mystra: • Makes critical technical decisions
Mystra: • Ensures everything works together
Mystra: • Plans for future growth
- What do they design?
	=> design_phase
- How do they lead?
	=> leadership_role
- What tools do they use?
	=> architect_tools

~ design_phase
Mystra: Think of software architecture like building a city:
Mystra: They plan:
Mystra: • How different parts connect
Mystra: • Which technologies to use
Mystra: • How data flows through the system
Mystra: For example, they might decide whether an app needs microservices or a simpler structure.
